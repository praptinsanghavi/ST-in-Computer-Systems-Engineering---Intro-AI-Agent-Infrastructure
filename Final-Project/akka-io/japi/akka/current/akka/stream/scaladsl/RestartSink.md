# RestartSink

## Content

Package [akka.stream.scaladsl](package-summary.html)
## Class RestartSink

- java.lang.Object
- - akka.stream.scaladsl.RestartSink

- ---

```
public class RestartSink
extends java.lang.Object
```

A RestartSink wraps a [`Sink`](Sink.html "class in akka.stream.scaladsl") that gets restarted when it completes or fails.
 
 They are useful for graphs that need to run for longer than the [`Sink`](Sink.html "class in akka.stream.scaladsl") can necessarily guarantee it will, for
 example, for [`Sink`](Sink.html "class in akka.stream.scaladsl") streams that depend on a remote server that may crash or become partitioned. The
 RestartSink ensures that the graph can continue running while the [`Sink`](Sink.html "class in akka.stream.scaladsl") restarts.

		public static <T> [Sink](Sink.html "class in akka.stream.scaladsl")<T,​[NotUsed](../../NotUsed.html "class in akka")> withBackoff​(scala.concurrent.duration.FiniteDuration minBackoff,
		                                                    scala.concurrent.duration.FiniteDuration maxBackoff,

		```
		
		Deprecated.
		Use the overloaded method which accepts akka.stream.RestartSettings instead. Since 2\.6\.10\.
		
		Wrap the given [`Sink`](Sink.html "class in akka.stream.scaladsl") with a [`Sink`](Sink.html "class in akka.stream.scaladsl") that will restart it when it fails or complete using an exponential
		 backoff.
		 
		 This [`Sink`](Sink.html "class in akka.stream.scaladsl") will never cancel, since cancellation by the wrapped [`Sink`](Sink.html "class in akka.stream.scaladsl") is always handled by restarting it.
		 The wrapped [`Sink`](Sink.html "class in akka.stream.scaladsl") can however be completed by feeding a completion or error into this [`Sink`](Sink.html "class in akka.stream.scaladsl"). When that
		 happens, the [`Sink`](Sink.html "class in akka.stream.scaladsl"), if currently running, will terminate and will not be restarted. This can be triggered
		 simply by the upstream completing, or externally by introducing a `KillSwitch` right before this [`Sink`](Sink.html "class in akka.stream.scaladsl") in the
		 graph.
		 
		
		
		 The restart process is inherently lossy, since there is no coordination between cancelling and the sending of
		 messages. When the wrapped [`Sink`](Sink.html "class in akka.stream.scaladsl") does cancel, this [`Sink`](Sink.html "class in akka.stream.scaladsl") will backpressure, however any elements already
		 sent may have been lost.
		 
		
		
		 This uses the same exponential backoff algorithm as [`BackoffOpts`](../../pattern/BackoffOpts.html "class in akka.pattern").
		 
		
		
		
		Parameters:
		`minBackoff` \- minimum (initial) duration until the child actor will
		 started again, if it is terminated
		`maxBackoff` \- the exponential back\-off is capped to this duration
		`randomFactor` \- after calculation of the exponential back\-off an additional
		 random delay based on this factor is added, e.g. `0.2` adds up to `20%` delay.
		 In order to skip this additional delay pass in `0`.
		`sinkFactory` \- A factory for producing the [`Sink`](Sink.html "class in akka.stream.scaladsl") to wrap.

		```
		
		Deprecated.
		Use the overloaded method which accepts akka.stream.RestartSettings instead. Since 2\.6\.10\.
		
		Wrap the given [`Sink`](Sink.html "class in akka.stream.scaladsl") with a [`Sink`](Sink.html "class in akka.stream.scaladsl") that will restart it when it fails or complete using an exponential
		 backoff.
		 
		 This [`Sink`](Sink.html "class in akka.stream.scaladsl") will not cancel as long as maxRestarts is not reached, since cancellation by the wrapped [`Sink`](Sink.html "class in akka.stream.scaladsl")
		 is handled by restarting it. The wrapped [`Sink`](Sink.html "class in akka.stream.scaladsl") can however be completed by feeding a completion or error into
		 this [`Sink`](Sink.html "class in akka.stream.scaladsl"). When that happens, the [`Sink`](Sink.html "class in akka.stream.scaladsl"), if currently running, will terminate and will not be restarted.

		 In order to skip this additional delay pass in `0`.
		`maxRestarts` \- the amount of restarts is capped to this amount within a time frame of minBackoff.
		 Passing `0` will cause no restarts and a negative number will not cap the amount of restarts.
		`sinkFactory` \- A factory for producing the [`Sink`](Sink.html "class in akka.stream.scaladsl") to wrap.
