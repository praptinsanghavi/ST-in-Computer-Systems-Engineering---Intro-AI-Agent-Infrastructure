# RestartSource

## Content

Package [akka.stream.javadsl](package-summary.html)
## Class RestartSource

- java.lang.Object
- - akka.stream.javadsl.RestartSource

- ---

```
public class RestartSource
extends java.lang.Object
```

A RestartSource wraps a [`Source`](Source.html "class in akka.stream.javadsl") that gets restarted when it completes or fails.
 
 They are useful for graphs that need to run for longer than the [`Source`](Source.html "class in akka.stream.javadsl") can necessarily guarantee it will, for
 example, for [`Source`](Source.html "class in akka.stream.javadsl") streams that depend on a remote server that may crash or become partitioned. The
 RestartSource ensures that the graph can continue running while the [`Source`](Source.html "class in akka.stream.javadsl") restarts.

		```
		
		Deprecated.
		Use the overloaded method which accepts akka.stream.RestartSettings instead. Since 2\.6\.10\.
		
		Wrap the given [`Source`](Source.html "class in akka.stream.javadsl") with a [`Source`](Source.html "class in akka.stream.javadsl") that will restart it when it fails or complete using an exponential
		 backoff.
		 
		 This [`Source`](Source.html "class in akka.stream.javadsl") will never emit a complete or failure, since the completion or failure of the wrapped [`Source`](Source.html "class in akka.stream.javadsl")
		 is always handled by restarting it. The wrapped [`Source`](Source.html "class in akka.stream.javadsl") can however be cancelled by cancelling this [`Source`](Source.html "class in akka.stream.javadsl").
		 When that happens, the wrapped [`Source`](Source.html "class in akka.stream.javadsl"), if currently running will be cancelled, and it will not be restarted.
		 This can be triggered simply by the downstream cancelling, or externally by introducing a `KillSwitch` right
		 after this [`Source`](Source.html "class in akka.stream.javadsl") in the graph.
		 
		
		
		 This uses the same exponential backoff algorithm as [`BackoffOpts`](../../pattern/BackoffOpts.html "class in akka.pattern").
		 
		
		
		
		Parameters:
		`minBackoff` \- minimum (initial) duration until the child actor will
		 started again, if it is terminated
		`maxBackoff` \- the exponential back\-off is capped to this duration
		`randomFactor` \- after calculation of the exponential back\-off an additional
		 random delay based on this factor is added, e.g. `0.2` adds up to `20%` delay.
		 In order to skip this additional delay pass in `0`.
		`sourceFactory` \- A factory for producing the [`Source`](Source.html "class in akka.stream.javadsl") to wrap.

		Wrap the given [`Source`](Source.html "class in akka.stream.javadsl") with a [`Source`](Source.html "class in akka.stream.javadsl") that will restart it when it fails or complete using an exponential
		 backoff.
		 
		 This [`Source`](Source.html "class in akka.stream.javadsl") will not emit a complete or failure as long as maxRestarts is not reached, since the completion

		 In order to skip this additional delay pass in `0`.
		`maxRestarts` \- the amount of restarts is capped to this amount within a time frame of minBackoff.
		 Passing `0` will cause no restarts and a negative number will not cap the amount of restarts.
		`sourceFactory` \- A factory for producing the [`Source`](Source.html "class in akka.stream.javadsl") to wrap.
