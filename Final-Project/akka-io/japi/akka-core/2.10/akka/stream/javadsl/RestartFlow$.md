# RestartFlow$

## Content

Package [akka.stream.javadsl](package-summary.html)
## Class RestartFlow$

- java.lang.Object
- - akka.stream.javadsl.RestartFlow$

- ---

```
public class RestartFlow$
extends java.lang.Object
```

A RestartFlow wraps a [`Flow`](Flow.html "class in akka.stream.javadsl") that gets restarted when it completes or fails.
 
 They are useful for graphs that need to run for longer than the [`Flow`](Flow.html "class in akka.stream.javadsl") can necessarily guarantee it will, for
 example, for [`Flow`](Flow.html "class in akka.stream.javadsl") streams that depend on a remote server that may crash or become partitioned. The
 RestartFlow ensures that the graph can continue running while the [`Flow`](Flow.html "class in akka.stream.javadsl") restarts.

		```
		
		Deprecated.
		Use the overloaded method which accepts akka.stream.RestartSettings instead. Since 2\.6\.10\.
		
		Wrap the given [`Flow`](Flow.html "class in akka.stream.javadsl") with a [`Flow`](Flow.html "class in akka.stream.javadsl") that will restart it when it fails or complete using an exponential
		 backoff.
		 
		 This [`Flow`](Flow.html "class in akka.stream.javadsl") will not cancel, complete or emit a failure, until the opposite end of it has been cancelled or
		 completed. Any termination by the [`Flow`](Flow.html "class in akka.stream.javadsl") before that time will be handled by restarting it. Any termination
		 signals sent to this [`Flow`](Flow.html "class in akka.stream.javadsl") however will terminate the wrapped [`Flow`](Flow.html "class in akka.stream.javadsl"), if it's running, and then the [`Flow`](Flow.html "class in akka.stream.javadsl")
		 will be allowed to terminate without being restarted.
		 
		
		
		 The restart process is inherently lossy, since there is no coordination between cancelling and the sending of
		 messages. A termination signal from either end of the wrapped [`Flow`](Flow.html "class in akka.stream.javadsl") will cause the other end to be terminated,
		 and any in transit messages will be lost. During backoff, this [`Flow`](Flow.html "class in akka.stream.javadsl") will backpressure.
		 
		
		
		 This uses the same exponential backoff algorithm as [`BackoffOpts`](../../pattern/BackoffOpts.html "class in akka.pattern").
		 
		
		
		
		Parameters:
		`minBackoff` \- minimum (initial) duration until the child actor will
		 started again, if it is terminated
		`maxBackoff` \- the exponential back\-off is capped to this duration
		`randomFactor` \- after calculation of the exponential back\-off an additional
		 random delay based on this factor is added, e.g. `0.2` adds up to `20%` delay.
		 In order to skip this additional delay pass in `0`.
		`flowFactory` \- A factory for producing the [`Flow`](Flow.html "class in akka.stream.javadsl") to wrap.
