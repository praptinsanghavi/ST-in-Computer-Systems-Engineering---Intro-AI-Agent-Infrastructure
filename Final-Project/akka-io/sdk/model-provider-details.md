# AI model provider configuration :: Akka Documentation

## Content

# AI model provider configuration

Akka provides integration with several backend AI models. You are responsible for configuring the AI model provider for every agent you build, whether you do so with configuration settings or via code.

As discussed in the [Configuring the model](agents.html#model) section of the Agent documentation, supplying a model provider through code will override the model provider configured through `application.conf` settings. You can also have multiple model providers configured and then use the `fromConfig` method of the `ModelProvider` class to load a specific one.

This page provides a detailed list of all of the configuration values available to each provider. As with all Akka configuration, the model configuration is declared using the [HOCON](https://github.com/lightbend/config/blob/main/HOCON.md) format.

## Definitions

The following are a few definitions that might not be familiar to you. Not all models support these properties, but when they do, their definition remains the same.

### Temperature

A value from 0\.0 to 1\.0 that indicates the amount of randomness in the model output. Often described as controlling how "creative" a model can get. The lower the value, the more precise and strict you want the model to behave. The higher the value, the more you expect it to improvise and the less deterministic it will be.

### top\-p

This property refers to the "Nucleus sampling parameter." Controls text generation by only considering the most likely tokens whose cumulative probability
exceeds the threshold value. It helps balance between diversity and
quality of outputs—lower values (like 0\.3\) produce more focused,
predictable text while higher values (like 0\.9\) allow more creativity
and variation.

### top\-k

Top\-k sampling limits text generation to only the k most probable
tokens at each step, discarding all other possibilities regardless
of their probability. It provides a simpler way to control randomness,
smaller k values (like 10\) produce more focused outputs while larger
values (like 50\) allow for more diversity.

### max\-tokens or max\-completion\-tokens

If this value is supplied and the model supports this property, then it will stop operations in mid flight if the token quota runs out. It’s important to check *how* the model counts tokens, as some may count differently. Be aware of the fact that this parameter name frequently varies from one provider to the next. Make sure you’re using the right property name.

### Thinking

Some models support thinking, also sometimes referred to as "thought process" or reasoning, where the model generates an intermediate
thought process, breaking down bigger problems into smaller more manageable tasks. This can be good for more complex problems but comes
at the price of tokens used for the thought process.

For models that support thinking, it is enabled through model\-specific configuration, either by setting a thinking token budget, or
by a toggle. Thinking is disabled for all models by default.

## Model configuration

The following is a list of all natively supported model configurations. Remember that if you don’t see your model or model format here, you can always create your own custom configuration and still use all of the Agent\-related components.

## Default model configuration

The default model will be used if the agent doesn’t specify another model.

You can define a default model in `application.conf`:

src/main/resources/application.conf

```
akka.javasdk {
  agent {
    model-provider = openai

    openai {
      model-name = "gpt-4o-mini"
      api-key = ${?OPENAI_API_KEY}
    }
  }
}
```

The `model-provider` property points to the name of another configuration section, in this case `akka.javasdk.agent.openai`. That configuration section contains the actual configuration for the model provider, according to the properties described in below [Reference configurations](#_reference_configurations).

Another example where we have selected `anthropic` with `claude-sonnet-4` as the default model provider:

src/main/resources/application.conf

```
akka.javasdk {
  agent {
    model-provider = anthropic

    anthropic {
      model-name = "claude-opus-4-6"
      api-key = ${?ANTHROPIC_API_KEY}
      max-tokens = 5000
    }
  }
}
```

The API key can be defined with an environment variable, `OPENAI_API_KEY` or `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` in the above examples.

## Additional model request headers

All built in model providers support attaching extra HTTP headers to every request sent to the model API. This is useful for passing authentication tokens to an AI gateway or proxy, adding routing or tracing headers, or meeting any other header requirements imposed by the endpoint.

### Configuration

Set a global default in `application.conf` as a HOCON list of `name:value` strings:

```
akka.javasdk.agent.additional-model-request-headers = [
  "X-Custom-Header:value",
  "X-Custom-Header-2:value-2",
]
```

All providers inherit this value automatically. You can override it for a specific provider:

```
akka.javasdk.agent.openai.additional-model-request-headers = ["X-Custom-Header:value"]
```

### Environment variable

The global setting can also be supplied via environment variables, this is the recommended approach for secrets such as gateway tokens.

Each header entry is a separate environment variable with an incrementing numeric suffix:

```
ADDITIONAL_MODEL_REQUEST_HEADERS_0="Authorization:Bearer mytoken"
ADDITIONAL_MODEL_REQUEST_HEADERS_1="X-Custom-Header:value"
```

You can also set headers for a specific model provider using provider\-specific environment variables. These replace the inherited global headers for that provider:

| Provider | Environment variable prefix |
| --- | --- |
| `Anthropic` | `ADDITIONAL_ANTHROPIC_REQUEST_HEADERS_N` |
| `OpenAI` | `ADDITIONAL_OPENAI_REQUEST_HEADERS_N` |
| `Google AI Gemini` | `ADDITIONAL_GOOGLE_AI_GEMINI_REQUEST_HEADERS_N` |
| `Google Cloud Vertex AI` | `ADDITIONAL_VERTEX_AI_REQUEST_HEADERS_N` |
| `Ollama` | `ADDITIONAL_OLLAMA_REQUEST_HEADERS_N` |
| `Local AI` | `ADDITIONAL_LOCAL_AI_REQUEST_HEADERS_N` |
| `Hugging Face` | `ADDITIONAL_HUGGING_FACE_REQUEST_HEADERS_N` |
| `Bedrock` | `ADDITIONAL_BEDROCK_REQUEST_HEADERS_N` |

For example, to set a header only for Anthropic requests:

```
ADDITIONAL_ANTHROPIC_REQUEST_HEADERS_0="Authorization:Bearer mytoken"
```

### Programmatic override

Headers can also be set directly in code, which overrides any configuration value for that model:

```
ModelProvider.openAi()
    .withApiKey(System.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY"))
    .withAdditionalModelRequestHeaders(
        List.of(RawHeader.create("Authorization", "Bearer mygatewaytoken")));
```

## Reference configurations

The following is a list of the various reference configurations for each of the AI models

Note that the following reference configurations are the default values, and you would typically only define the properties that you want to override, such as:

```
akka.javasdk.agent.openai {
  model-name = "gpt-4o-mini"
}
```

You may also have to use a fallback to the reference configuration if you use a different configuration section:

```
gpt-o3 = ${akka.javasdk.agent.openai}
gpt-o3 {
  model-name = "o3"
  max-completion-tokens = 200000
}
```

### Custom

If none of the built\-in providers fit your needs, you can implement a custom model provider. Set the `provider` property to the fully qualified class name (FQCN) of your implementation.

The custom class must implement the `ModelProvider.Custom` interface, which requires two methods: `createChatModel()` and `createStreamingChatModel()`. These should return instances of Langchain4j’s `ChatModel` and `StreamingChatModel` respectively. If streaming is not needed, `createStreamingChatModel()` can throw an exception. Overriding the `modelName()` method allows to pass this information to observability attributes.

```
akka.javasdk {
  agent {
    model-provider = my-provider

    my-provider {
      # fully qualified class name of the provider implementation
      provider = "com.example.application.MyModelProvider"
      # additional settings
      model-name = "gpt-4o-mini"
      api-key = ""
      api-key = ${?MY_PROVIDER_API_KEY}
    }
  }
}
```

Any additional properties in the configuration section (such as `model-name` or `api-key`) are available to the provider implementation through an injected `Config` parameter.

com/example/application/MyModelProvider.java

```
public class MyModelProvider implements ModelProvider.Custom {

  private final String modelName;

  public MyModelProvider(Config config) { (1)
    modelName = config.getString("model-name");
    //TODO model provider initialization based on injected config
  }

  @Override
  public String modelName() {
    return modelName;
  }

  @Override
  public Object createChatModel() { (2)
    //TODO return ChatModel implementation
    return null;
  }

  @Override
  public Object createStreamingChatModel() { (3)
    //TODO return StreamingChatModel implementation
    return null;
  }
}
```

| **1** | If the constructor accepts a `com.typesafe.config.Config` parameter, the full provider configuration section is injected automatically. A no\-arg constructor is also supported. |
| --- | --- |
| **2** | Return an instance of `dev.langchain4j.model.chat.ChatModel`. |
| **3** | Return an instance of `dev.langchain4j.model.chat.StreamingChatModel`, or throw an exception if streaming is not needed. |

## Code Examples

### Example 1: Default model configuration
