# Default configuration • Akka Documentation

> **Summary:** Akka is a toolkit for building highly concurrent, distributed, and resilient message-driven applications for Java and Scala.

## Content

# Default configuration

Each Akka module has a `reference.conf` file with the default values.

Make your edits/overrides in your `application.conf`. Don’t override default values if you are not sure of the implications. [Akka Config Checker](https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka-diagnostics/current/config-checker.html) is a useful tool for finding potential configuration issues.

The purpose of `reference.conf` files is for libraries, like Akka, to define default values that are used if an application doesn’t define a more specific value. It’s also a good place to document the existence and meaning of the configuration properties. One library must not try to override properties in its own `reference.conf` for properties originally defined by another library’s `reference.conf`, because the effective value would be nondeterministic when loading the configuration.\`

        # data, this features delays sending a write immediately by probing the stream
        # for more writes. This works by rescheduling the TCP connection stage via the
        # actor mailbox of the underlying actor. Thus, before the stage is reactivated
        # the upstream gets another opportunity to emit writes.
        #
        # When the stage is reactivated and if new writes are detected another round-trip
        # is scheduled. The loop repeats until either the number of round trips given in this

        # were detected during the last round-trip.

        # blocking (CPU-bound) way.

        # In that case, the feature can either be disabled, or the producing CPU-bound
