# Configuration • Akka Documentation

> **Summary:** Akka is a toolkit for building highly concurrent, distributed, and resilient message-driven applications for Java and Scala.

## Content

# Configuration

You can start using Akka without defining any configuration, since sensible default values are provided. Later on you might need to amend the settings to change the default behavior or adapt for specific runtime environments. Typical examples of settings that you might amend:

- log level and logger backend
- enable remoting
- message serializers
- definition of routers
- tuning of dispatchers

Akka uses the [Typesafe Config Library](https://github.com/typesafehub/config), which might also be a good choice for the configuration of your own application or library built with or without Akka. This library is implemented in Java with no external dependencies; you should have a look at its documentation (in particular about [ConfigFactory](https://lightbend.github.io/config/latest/api/com/typesafe/config/ConfigFactory.html)), which is only summarized in the following.

Warning
If you use Akka from the Scala REPL from the 2\.9\.x series, and you do not provide your own ClassLoader to the ActorSystem, start the REPL with “\-Yrepl\-sync” to work around a deficiency in the REPLs provided Context ClassLoader.

## Where configuration is read from

All configuration for Akka is held within instances of `ActorSystem`, or put differently, as viewed from the outside, `ActorSystem` is the only consumer of configuration information. While constructing an actor system, you can either pass in a `Config` object or not, where the second case is equivalent to passing `ConfigFactory.load()` (with the right class loader). This means roughly that the default is to parse all `application.conf`, `application.json` and `application.properties` found at the root of the class path—please refer to the aforementioned documentation for details. The actor system then merges in all `reference.conf` resources found at the root of the class path to form the fallback configuration, i.e. it internally uses

```
appConfig.withFallback(ConfigFactory.defaultReference(classLoader))

```

The philosophy is that code never contains default values, but instead relies upon their presence in the `reference.conf` supplied with the library in question.

Highest precedence is given to overrides given as system properties, see [the HOCON specification](https://github.com/typesafehub/config/blob/master/HOCON.md) (near the bottom). Also noteworthy is that the application configuration—which defaults to `application`—may be overridden using the `config.resource` property (there are more, please refer to the [Config docs](https://github.com/typesafehub/config/blob/master/README.md)).

Note
If you are writing an Akka application, keep your configuration in `application.conf` at the root of the class path. If you are writing an Akka\-based library, keep its configuration in `reference.conf` at the root of the JAR file.

## When using JarJar, OneJar, Assembly or any jar\-bundler

Warning
Akka’s configuration approach relies heavily on the notion of every module/jar having its own reference.conf file, all of these will be discovered by the configuration and loaded. Unfortunately this also means that if you put/merge multiple jars into the same jar, you need to merge all the reference.confs as well. Otherwise all defaults will be lost and Akka will not function.

If you are using Maven to package your application, you can also make use of the [Apache Maven Shade Plugin](http://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-shade-plugin) support for [Resource Transformers](http://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-shade-plugin/examples/resource-transformers.html#AppendingTransformer) to merge all the reference.confs on the build classpath into one. 

The plugin configuration might look like this:

```
<plugin>
 <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
 <artifactId>maven-shade-plugin</artifactId>
 <version>1.5</version>
 <executions>
  <execution>
   <phase>package</phase>
   <goals>
    <goal>shade</goal>
   </goals>
   <configuration>
    <shadedArtifactAttached>true</shadedArtifactAttached>
    <shadedClassifierName>allinone</shadedClassifierName>
    <artifactSet>
     <includes>
      <include>*:*</include>
     </includes>
    </artifactSet>
    <transformers>
      <transformer
       implementation="org.apache.maven.plugins.shade.resource.AppendingTransformer">
       <resource>reference.conf</resource>
      </transformer>
      <transformer
       implementation="org.apache.maven.plugins.shade.resource.ManifestResourceTransformer">
       <manifestEntries>
        <Main-Class>akka.Main</Main-Class>
       </manifestEntries>
      </transformer>
    </transformers>
   </configuration>
  </execution>
 </executions>
</plugin>

```

## Custom application.conf

A custom `application.conf` might look like this:

```
# In this file you can override any option defined in the reference files.
# Copy in parts of the reference files and modify as you please.

akka {

  # Loggers to register at boot time (akka.event.Logging$DefaultLogger logs
  # to STDOUT)
  loggers = ["akka.event.slf4j.Slf4jLogger"]

  # Log level used by the configured loggers (see "loggers") as soon
  # as they have been started; before that, see "stdout-loglevel"
  # Options: OFF, ERROR, WARNING, INFO, DEBUG
  loglevel = "DEBUG"

  # Log level for the very basic logger activated during ActorSystem startup.
  # This logger prints the log messages to stdout (System.out).
  # Options: OFF, ERROR, WARNING, INFO, DEBUG
  stdout-loglevel = "DEBUG"

  # Filter of log events that is used by the LoggingAdapter before
  # publishing log events to the eventStream.
  logging-filter = "akka.event.slf4j.Slf4jLoggingFilter"

  actor {
    provider = "cluster"

    default-dispatcher {
      # Throughput for default Dispatcher, set to 1 for as fair as possible
      throughput = 10
    }
  }

  remote {
    # The port clients should connect to. Default is 2552.
    netty.tcp.port = 4711
  }
}

```

## Including files

Sometimes it can be useful to include another configuration file, for example if you have one `application.conf` with all environment independent settings and then override some settings for specific environments.

Specifying system property with `-Dconfig.resource=/dev.conf` will load the `dev.conf` file, which includes the `application.conf`

### dev.conf

```
include "application"

akka {
  loglevel = "DEBUG"
}

```

More advanced include and substitution mechanisms are explained in the [HOCON](https://github.com/typesafehub/config/blob/master/HOCON.md) specification.

## Logging of Configuration

If the system or config property `akka.log-config-on-start` is set to `on`, then the complete configuration is logged at INFO level when the actor system is started. This is useful when you are uncertain of what configuration is used.

If in doubt, you can inspect your configuration objects before or after using them to construct an actor system:

```
Welcome to Scala 2.12 (Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM, Java 1.8.0).
Type in expressions to have them evaluated.
Type :help for more information.

scala> import com.typesafe.config._
import com.typesafe.config._

scala> ConfigFactory.parseString("a.b=12")
res0: com.typesafe.config.Config = Config(SimpleConfigObject({"a" : {"b" : 12}}))

scala> res0.root.render
res1: java.lang.String =
{
    # String: 1
    "a" : {
        # String: 1
        "b" : 12
    }
}

```

The comments preceding every item give detailed information about the origin of the setting (file \& line number) plus possible comments which were present, e.g. in the reference configuration. The settings as merged with the reference and parsed by the actor system can be displayed like this:

```
final ActorSystem system = ActorSystem.create();
System.out.println(system.settings());
// this is a shortcut for system.settings().config().root().render()

```

## A Word About ClassLoaders

In several places of the configuration file it is possible to specify the fully\-qualified class name of something to be instantiated by Akka. This is done using Java reflection, which in turn uses a `ClassLoader`. Getting the right one in challenging environments like application containers or OSGi bundles is not always trivial, the current approach of Akka is that each `ActorSystem` implementation stores the current thread’s context class loader (if available, otherwise just its own loader as in `this.getClass.getClassLoader`) and uses that for all reflective accesses. This implies that putting Akka on the boot class path will yield `NullPointerException` from strange places: this is not supported.

## Application specific settings

The configuration can also be used for application specific settings. A good practice is to place those settings in an [Extension](../extending-akka.html#extending-akka-settings).

## Configuring multiple ActorSystem

If you have more than one `ActorSystem` (or you’re writing a library and have an `ActorSystem` that may be separate from the application’s) you may want to separate the configuration for each system.

Given that `ConfigFactory.load()` merges all resources with matching name from the whole class path, it is easiest to utilize that functionality and differentiate actor systems within the hierarchy of the configuration:

```
myapp1 {
  akka.loglevel = "WARNING"
  my.own.setting = 43
}
myapp2 {
  akka.loglevel = "ERROR"
  app2.setting = "appname"
}
my.own.setting = 42
my.other.setting = "hello"

```

```
val config = ConfigFactory.load()
val app1 = ActorSystem("MyApp1", config.getConfig("myapp1").withFallback(config))
val app2 = ActorSystem("MyApp2",
  config.getConfig("myapp2").withOnlyPath("akka").withFallback(config))

```

These two samples demonstrate different variations of the “lift\-a\-subtree” trick: in the first case, the configuration accessible from within the actor system is this

```
akka.loglevel = "WARNING"
my.own.setting = 43
my.other.setting = "hello"
// plus myapp1 and myapp2 subtrees

```

while in the second one, only the “akka” subtree is lifted, with the following result

```
akka.loglevel = "ERROR"
my.own.setting = 42
my.other.setting = "hello"
// plus myapp1 and myapp2 subtrees

```
Note
The configuration library is really powerful, explaining all features exceeds the scope affordable here. In particular not covered are how to include other configuration files within other files (see a small example at [Including files](#including-files)) and copying parts of the configuration tree by way of path substitutions.

You may also specify and parse the configuration programmatically in other ways when instantiating the `ActorSystem`.

```
[source](https://github.com/akka/akka/tree/v2.5.32/akka-docs/src/test/scala/docs/config/ConfigDocSpec.scala#L12-L13 "Go to snippet source")import akka.actor.ActorSystem
import com.typesafe.config.ConfigFactory
val customConf = ConfigFactory.parseString("""
  akka.actor.deployment {
    /my-service {
      router = round-robin-pool
      nr-of-instances = 3
    }
  }
  """)
// ConfigFactory.load sandwiches customConfig between default reference
// config and default overrides, and then resolves it.
val system = ActorSystem("MySystem", ConfigFactory.load(customConf))
```

## Reading configuration from a custom location

You can replace or supplement `application.conf` either in code or using system properties.

If you’re using `ConfigFactory.load()` (which Akka does by default) you can replace `application.conf` by defining `-Dconfig.resource=whatever`, `-Dconfig.file=whatever`, or `-Dconfig.url=whatever`.

From inside your replacement file specified with `-Dconfig.resource` and friends, you can `include
"application"` if you still want to use `application.{conf,json,properties}` as well. Settings specified before `include "application"` would be overridden by the included file, while those after would override the included file.

In code, there are many customization options.

There are several overloads of `ConfigFactory.load()`; these allow you to specify something to be sandwiched between system properties (which override) and the defaults (from `reference.conf`), replacing the usual `application.{conf,json,properties}` and replacing `-Dconfig.file` and friends.

The simplest variant of `ConfigFactory.load()` takes a resource basename (instead of `application`); `myname.conf`, `myname.json`, and `myname.properties` would then be used instead of `application.{conf,json,properties}`.

The most flexible variant takes a `Config` object, which you can load using any method in `ConfigFactory`. For example you could put a config string in code using `ConfigFactory.parseString()` or you could make a map and `ConfigFactory.parseMap()`, or you could load a file.

You can also combine your custom config with the usual config, that might look like:

```
[source](https://github.com/akka/akka/tree/v2.5.32/akka-docs/src/test/java/jdocs/config/ConfigDoc.java#L13-L24 "Go to snippet source")// make a Config with just your special setting
Config myConfig = ConfigFactory.parseString("something=somethingElse");
// load the normal config stack (system props,
// then application.conf, then reference.conf)
Config regularConfig = ConfigFactory.load();
// override regular stack with myConfig
Config combined = myConfig.withFallback(regularConfig);
// put the result in between the overrides
// (system props) and defaults again
Config complete = ConfigFactory.load(combined);
// create ActorSystem
ActorSystem system = ActorSystem.create("myname", complete);
```

When working with `Config` objects, keep in mind that there are three “layers” in the cake:

- `ConfigFactory.defaultOverrides()` (system properties)
- the app’s settings
- `ConfigFactory.defaultReference()` (reference.conf)

The normal goal is to customize the middle layer while leaving the other two alone.

- `ConfigFactory.load()` loads the whole stack
- the overloads of `ConfigFactory.load()` let you specify a different middle layer
- the `ConfigFactory.parse()` variations load single files or resources

To stack two layers, use `override.withFallback(fallback)`; try to keep system props (`defaultOverrides()`) on top and `reference.conf` (`defaultReference()`) on the bottom.

Do keep in mind, you can often just add another `include` statement in `application.conf` rather than writing code. Includes at the top of `application.conf` will be overridden by the rest of `application.conf`, while those at the bottom will override the earlier stuff.

## Actor Deployment Configuration

Deployment settings for specific actors can be defined in the `akka.actor.deployment` section of the configuration. In the deployment section it is possible to define things like dispatcher, mailbox, router settings, and remote deployment. Configuration of these features are described in the chapters detailing corresponding topics. An example may look like this:

```
[source](https://github.com/akka/akka/tree/v2.5.32/akka-docs/src/test/scala/docs/config/ConfigDocSpec.scala#L40-L76 "Go to snippet source")akka.actor.deployment {

  # '/user/actorA/actorB' is a remote deployed actor
  /actorA/actorB {
    remote = "akka.tcp://[[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection):2553"
  }
  
  # all direct children of '/user/actorC' have a dedicated dispatcher 
  "/actorC/*" {
    dispatcher = my-dispatcher
  }

  # all descendants of '/user/actorC' (direct children, and their children recursively)
  # have a dedicated dispatcher
  "/actorC/**" {
    dispatcher = my-dispatcher
  }
  
  # '/user/actorD/actorE' has a special priority mailbox
  /actorD/actorE {
    mailbox = prio-mailbox
  }
  
  # '/user/actorF/actorG/actorH' is a random pool
  /actorF/actorG/actorH {
    router = random-pool
    nr-of-instances = 5
  }
}

my-dispatcher {
  fork-join-executor.parallelism-min = 10
  fork-join-executor.parallelism-max = 10
}
prio-mailbox {
  mailbox-type = "a.b.MyPrioMailbox"
}
```
Note
The deployment section for a specific actor is identified by the path of the actor relative to `/user`.

You can use asterisks as wildcard matches for the actor path sections, so you could specify: `/*/sampleActor` and that would match all `sampleActor` on that level in the hierarchy. In addition, please note:

- you can also use wildcards in the last position to match all actors at a certain level: `/someParent/*`
- you can use double\-wildcards in the last position to match all child actors and their children recursively: `/someParent/**`
- non\-wildcard matches always have higher priority to match than wildcards, and single wildcard matches have higher priority than double\-wildcards, so: `/foo/bar` is considered **more specific** than `/foo/*`, which is considered **more specific** than `/foo/**`. Only the highest priority match is used
- wildcards **cannot** be used to partially match section, like this: `/foo*/bar`, `/f*o/bar` etc.

Note
Double\-wildcards can only be placed in the last position.

```

### Example 4: dev.conf

```text
include "application"

akka {
  loglevel = "DEBUG"
}
```

### Example 5: Logging of Configuration

```text
Welcome to Scala 2.12 (Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM, Java 1.8.0).
Type in expressions to have them evaluated.
Type :help for more information.

scala> import com.typesafe.config._
import com.typesafe.config._

scala> ConfigFactory.parseString("a.b=12")
res0: com.typesafe.config.Config = Config(SimpleConfigObject({"a" : {"b" : 12}}))

scala> res0.root.render
res1: java.lang.String =
{
    # String: 1
    "a" : {
        # String: 1
        "b" : 12
    }
}
```

### Example 6: Logging of Configuration

```java
final ActorSystem system = ActorSystem.create();
System.out.println(system.settings());
// this is a shortcut for system.settings().config().root().render()
```

### Example 7: Configuring multiple ActorSystem

```text
myapp1 {
  akka.loglevel = "WARNING"
  my.own.setting = 43
}
myapp2 {
  akka.loglevel = "ERROR"
  app2.setting = "appname"
}
my.own.setting = 42
my.other.setting = "hello"
```

### Example 8: Configuring multiple ActorSystem

```scala
val config = ConfigFactory.load()
val app1 = ActorSystem("MyApp1", config.getConfig("myapp1").withFallback(config))
val app2 = ActorSystem("MyApp2",
  config.getConfig("myapp2").withOnlyPath("akka").withFallback(config))
```

### Example 9: Configuring multiple ActorSystem

```ruby
akka.loglevel = "WARNING"
my.own.setting = 43
my.other.setting = "hello"
// plus myapp1 and myapp2 subtrees
```

### Example 10: Configuring multiple ActorSystem

```ruby
akka.loglevel = "ERROR"
my.own.setting = 42
my.other.setting = "hello"
// plus myapp1 and myapp2 subtrees
```

### Example 11: Configuring multiple ActorSystem

```scala
import akka.actor.ActorSystem
import com.typesafe.config.ConfigFactory
val customConf = ConfigFactory.parseString("""
  akka.actor.deployment {
    /my-service {
      router = round-robin-pool
      nr-of-instances = 3
    }
  }
  """)
// ConfigFactory.load sandwiches customConfig between default reference
// config and default overrides, and then resolves it.
val system = ActorSystem("MySystem", ConfigFactory.load(customConf))
```

### Example 12: Reading configuration from a custom location

```java
// make a Config with just your special setting
Config myConfig = ConfigFactory.parseString("something=somethingElse");
// load the normal config stack (system props,
// then application.conf, then reference.conf)
Config regularConfig = ConfigFactory.load();
// override regular stack with myConfig
Config combined = myConfig.withFallback(regularConfig);
// put the result in between the overrides
// (system props) and defaults again
Config complete = ConfigFactory.load(combined);
// create ActorSystem
ActorSystem system = ActorSystem.create("myname", complete);
```

### Example 13: Actor Deployment Configuration

```scala
akka.actor.deployment {

  # '/user/actorA/actorB' is a remote deployed actor
  /actorA/actorB {
    remote = "akka.tcp://[email protected]:2553"
  }

  # have a dedicated dispatcher
  "/actorC/**" {
    dispatcher = my-dispatcher

  # '/user/actorD/actorE' has a special priority mailbox
  /actorD/actorE {
    mailbox = prio-mailbox
  }
  
  # '/user/actorF/actorG/actorH' is a random pool
  /actorF/actorG/actorH {
    router = random-pool
    nr-of-instances = 5
  }
}

my-dispatcher {
  fork-join-executor.parallelism-min = 10
  fork-join-executor.parallelism-max = 10
